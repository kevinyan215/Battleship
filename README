6. Note: To play new game, you must restart the app. If the simulator screen is too big, you can go to Window -> Scale in the simulator to resize. Also, I wasnâ€™t unable to take screenshots of the screen right after launching a missile because the segue transitions too fast, but you can see the result on the other screens to see that the missiles were launched.
